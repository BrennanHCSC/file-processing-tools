The snowman was a jolly happy soul 
with a corn-cop pipe and a button nose and two eyes made out of coal. 
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say 
he was made of snow but the children know how he came to life one day 
there must have been some magic in that old silk hat they found 
for when they placed it on his head he began to dance around 
oh frosty the snowman was alive as he could be 
and the children say he could laugh and play 
just the same as you went with 
some pretty some some some pretty some some 
look at frosty go 
some pretty some some some 
over the hills and snow 
oh frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day 
so he said let's run and we'll have some fun now before I melt away 
down to the village with a broomstick in his hand 
running here and there all around the square 
say and catch me if you can 
he led them down the streets of town right to the traffic cop 
and he only paused a moment when he heard him holler stop 
frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way 
but he waived goodbye say and don't you cry I'll be back again someday 
some pretty some some pretty some some 
look at frosty go 
some pretty some some some pretty some some 
over the hills and snow
