# File Processing Library

This library contains tools for processing various file types for several purposes. This includes extracting metadata, calculating metrics between files such as cosine similarity and Levenshtein distance. This software is under active development.

## Dependencies

This project has dependencies defined in `requirements.txt`. These dependencies should be installed using `pip3 install -r depencencies.txt`. Older versions of pip may result in an error.

Additionally, this project uses tesseract for OCR. This must be installed at: `C:/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Local/Programs/Tesseract-OCR/tesseract.exe`. See https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki.

This project also uses ffmpeg for audio/video file transcripting. You can download it from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html or install via Terminal using the following steps: 
1. Install scoop: `iwr -useb get.scoop.sh | iex` 
2. Install ffmpeg: `scoop install ffmpeg`


## Structure

This library contains several components in different directories:

- file_processing: Utilities for opening a variety of different file types.
- utils: support functions for the file_processing components.
- tests: pytest test cases
- tests/resources: files used as inputs for tests.

These include file processing tools (in the file_processing directory). This code is structured as follows:

- `file_processing.File`: Entry point for processing a file. It selects the appropriate processor for a given file based on the file type.
- `utils.FileProcessorStrategy`: An abstract base class (ABC) for processing files. Subclasses must implement the `process` method.
- `file_processing.TextFileProcessor` and `PdfFileProcessor`: They inherit from `FileProcessorStrategy` and implement `process` method for .txt and .pdf files respectively.
- `file_processing.FileMetricStrategy`: An ABC for calculating metrics between files. Subclasses must implement the `calculate` method.
- `utils.CosineSimilarity` and `utils.LevenshteinDistance`: They inherit from `FileMetricStrategy` and implement the `calculate` method to compute cosine similarity and Levenshtein distance between files.


## Things To Do

- [ ] Migrate this list to project milestones and issues
- [ ] Extend `FileProcessorStrategy` to include more detailed metadata
- [ ] Replace `print` statements with `logging` module
- [ ] Implement OCR functionality for processing image-based PDF files
- [ ] Integrate table extraction functionality
- [ ] Add docstrings and type hinting to all classes and methods
- [ ] Write tests to ensure the functionality of the library
- [ ] Add support for more file types (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx, etc.)
- [ ] Add more metrics for comparison between files (ex. jaccard)
