Express Entry is an online system that we use to manage immigration applications from skilled workers.

There are 3 immigration programs managed through Express Entry:

Canadian Experience Class
for skilled workers who have Canadian work experience
work experience must have been gained in the 3 years before you apply
Learn more

Federal Skilled Worker Program
for skilled workers with foreign work experience
must meet criteria for education and other factors
Learn more

Federal Skilled Trades Program
for skilled workers who are qualified in a skilled trade
must have a valid job offer or a certificate of qualification
Learn more

If you’re eligible for one of the above programs, you can also apply through Express Entry for the Provincial Nominee Program. If you’re nominated, you’ll get extra points so you can be invited to apply quickly.

Step 1: Find out if you’re eligible
There are 2 ways to find out if you’re eligible for a program that is part of Express Entry:

answer a few questions to see if you meet the minimum requirements
read the detailed requirements for each program
Step 2: Check your score
If you’re eligible for one or more of the Express Entry programs and submit your profile, you’ll be ranked in the Express Entry pool using the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS).

The CRS is a points-based system we use to

assess and score your profile and
rank it in the Express Entry pool
To be invited, you need to have a score above the minimum points score for your round of invitations.

Use the CRS tool to estimate your score.
Step 3: Get your documents ready
If you decide to fill out a profile, you’ll need documents, such as language test results, to show you’re eligible for Express Entry.

Some documents take a long time to get, so you should get them ready early.

Get the documents you need
Step 4: Fill out your profile
Your Express Entry profile is where you give us information about yourself.

If you’re eligible, we’ll accept you into our pool of candidates and give you a CRS score.

Submit your profile
Step 5: Get an invitation and apply
We send invitations to apply to the candidates with the highest scores in the pool. If we invite you to apply, you’ll have 60 days to submit your application.

We’ll process most complete applications that have all supporting documents in 6 months or less.

About Medicare
Medicare is a term that refers to Canada's publicly funded health care system. Instead of having a single national plan, we have 13 provincial and territorial health care insurance plans. Under this system, all Canadian residents have reasonable access to medically necessary hospital and physician services without paying out-of-pocket.

Roles and responsibilities for health care services are shared between provincial and territorial governments and the federal government.

The provincial and territorial governments are responsible for the management, organization and delivery of health care services for their residents.

The federal government is responsible for:

setting and administering national standards for the health care system through the Canada Health Act
providing funding support for provincial and territorial health care services
supporting the delivery for health care services to specific groups
providing other health-related functions
Canada Health Act
Provincial and territorial health care insurance plans must meet the standards described in the Canada Health Act. This is necessary to get their full payment under the Canada Health Transfer.

These standards include:

public administration
comprehensiveness
universality
portability
accessibility
Public administration
The provincial and territorial plans must be administered and operated on a non profit basis by a public authority.

Comprehensiveness
The provincial and territorial plans must insure all medically necessary services provided by:

hospitals
physicians
dentists, when the service must be performed in a hospital
Medically necessary services are not defined in the Canada Health Act. The provincial and territorial health care insurance plans consult with their respective physician colleges or groups. Together, they decide which services are medically necessary for health care insurance purposes.

If a service is considered medically necessary, the full cost must be covered by the public health care insurance plan.

Universality
The provincial and territorial plans must cover all residents.

Portability
The provincial and territorial plans must cover all residents when they travel within Canada. Limited coverage is also required for travel outside the country.

When a resident moves to another province, they can continue to use their original health care insurance card for 3 months. This gives them enough time to register for the new plan and receive their new health insurance card.

Accessibility
The provincial and territorial plans must provide all residents reasonable access to medically necessary services. Access must be based on medical need and not the ability to pay.

What is the most important cause of climate change?
Human activity is the main cause of climate change. People burn fossil fuels and convert land from forests to agriculture. Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, people have burned more and more fossil fuels and changed vast areas of land from forests to farmland.

Burning fossil fuels produces carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. It is called a greenhouse gas because it produces a “greenhouse effect”. The greenhouse effect makes the earth warmer, just as a greenhouse is warmer than its surroundings.

Carbon dioxide is the main cause of human-induced climate change.

It stays in the atmosphere for a very long time. Other greenhouse gases, such as nitrous oxide, stay in the atmosphere for a long time. Other substances only produce short-term effects.

Not all substances produce warming. Some, like certain aerosols, can produce cooling.

What are climate forcers?
Carbon dioxide and other substances are referred to as climate forcers because they force or push the climate towards being warmer or cooler. They do this by affecting the flow of energy coming into and leaving the earth’s climate system.

Small changes in the sun’s energy that reaches the earth can cause some climate change. But since the Industrial Revolution, adding greenhouse gases has been over 50 times more powerful than changes in the Sun's radiance. The additional greenhouse gases in earth’s atmosphere have had a strong warming effect on earth’s climate.

Future emissions of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, will determine how much more climate warming occurs.

What can be done about climate change?
Carbon dioxide is the main cause of human-induced global warming and associated climate change. It is a very long-lived gas, which means carbon dioxide builds up in the atmosphere with ongoing human emissions and remains in the atmosphere for centuries. Global warming can only be stopped by reducing global emissions of carbon dioxide from human fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes to zero, but even with zero emissions, the global temperature will remain essentially constant at its new warmer level. Emissions of other substances that warm the climate must also be substantially reduced. This indicates how difficult the challenge is.

What is climate change?
Climate change is a long-term shift in weather conditions identified by changes in temperature, precipitation, winds, and other indicators. Climate change can involve both changes in average conditions and changes in variability, including, for example, extreme events.

The earth's climate is naturally variable on all time scales. However, its long-term state and average temperature are regulated by the balance between incoming and outgoing energy, which determines the Earth's energy balance. Any factor that causes a sustained change to the amount of incoming energy or the amount of outgoing energy can lead to climate change.

Each type of court has its own jurisdiction, which means that it has the authority to decide specific types of cases. Canada has four levels of court.

Provincial and territorial (lower) courts: These courts handle most cases that come into the system. They are established by provincial and territorial governments.
Provincial and territorial superior courts: These are courts of plenary, or complete, jurisdiction established under section 96 of the Constitution Act, 1867. They deal with more serious crimes and also hear appeals from provincial and territorial courts. The Federal Court is on the same level, but is responsible for deciding civil matters assigned to it by statute, such as immigration and patents.

This chart provides an overview of the hierarchy of Canada’s Court System. It is arranged as follows:   

Courts

Supreme Court of Canada
Court Martial Appeal Court
Military Courts
Provincial/Territorial Courts of Appeals
Provincial/Territorial Superior Courts
Provincial/Territorial Courts
Federal Court of Appeal
Federal Court
Tax Court of Canada
Administrative Boards and Tribunals

Provincial/Territorial Administrative Tribunals
Federal Administrative Tribunals
Provincial/territorial courts
Each province and territory has a provincial/territorial court and hears cases involving either federal or provincial/territorial laws.

In Nunavut, the Nunavut Court of Justice, which is Canada’s only single-level trial court, combines the power of the superior trial court and the territorial court so that the same judge can hear all cases that arise in the territory.

Provincial/territorial courts deal with:

most criminal offences, except the most serious ones;
family law matters (e.g., child support, child protection, adoption, but not divorce);
young persons from 12 to 17 years old in conflict with the law;
traffic and bylaw violations;
provincial/territorial regulatory offences;
claims involving money, up to a certain amount (set by the province or territory in question);
small claims (civil cases that resolve private disputes involving limited sums of money); and
all preliminary inquiries (hearings to determine whether there is enough evidence to justify a full trial in serious criminal cases).
Some courts at this level are dedicated to particular types of offences or groups of offenders. One example is the Drug Treatment Court. The objective of these courts is to address the needs of non-violent offenders who are charged with criminal offences that were motivated by their addiction. Those who qualify are offered judicial supervision and treatment for their addiction, with the help of community support services.

From: Transport Canada


 

Canada’s skies are busy. Millions of flights and more than 150 million passengers travel our 15 million square kilometres of airspace every year.

Transport Canada’s Aviation Safety Program
We work with industry and government partners to help keep planes, people and airports safe and secure. We develop and implement policies, regulations and administer the Canadian Aviation Regulations (CARs).

We set the standards for aircraft designed and used in Canada to ensure all meet certification requirements and operational airworthiness. We also oversee the licensing and training of pilots, crew members and aircraft maintenance engineers.

The work we do is not only applicable to commercial air carriers and those who work in the industry but also for other aircraft such as drones, hot air balloons, gliders and helicopters. Given there are over 34, 000 privately licensed pilots, recreational aviation is a big part of Canadian aviation.

In addition to our regulatory approach for improving safety, we also rely on promotional and educational tools to promote adherence to safety regulations and best practices within the aviation industry and to build awareness of safety hazards and risks.

As aviation is a global industry, connecting people, goods, and communities around the world, it is vital that our work extends outside of Canada so that people can have confidence in the safety of the aviation system around the world. Canada is working with international partners and key stakeholders to enhance the level of safety and security for commercial airlines travelling in or near conflict zones.

Our work behind the scenes

Airport
We make and enforce regulations to:

keep take-off and landing zones free of obstacle
require runways, taxiways and airport lighting to be built to appropriate standards
Drones
We regulate the use of unmanned vehicles.

Wildlife
We help minimize the risks of wildlife hits.

Hangar
We:

make sure Approved Maintenance Organizations meet our regulations for performing maintenance on registered aircraft
issue Aircraft Maintenance Engineer licenses
set aircraft manufacturing and maintenance requirements
Airspace
We regulate 15 million square kilometres of airspace.

Control tower
We make sure that air traffic control activities meet our safety regulations.

Air carriers
We verify that the aviation industry complies with the regulations through oversight activities.

Flight deck
We:

set training standards
certify and monitor training schools and their programs
administer yearly examinations
set medical standards and procedures
Pilot
We:

review pilots’ physical and mental fitness
set flight and duty time requirements
Aircraft certification
We:

establish and regulate standards for Canadian aeronautical products
guide the industry through the certification process
ensure aircraft designs meet internationally accepted design standards
support the industry to take corrective action

Before you start: The plan
What is a business plan?
A business plan is a written document that describes your business objectives and strategies, your financial forecasts and the market you are targeting. It will help you set realistic and timely goals, secure external funding, measure your success, clarify operational requirements and establish reasonable financial forecasts. Preparing your plan will help you focus on how to operate your new business and give it the best chance for success.

Securing financial assistance to start your new business is directly related to the strength of your business plan. To be considered for funding from financial institutions or investors, you must demonstrate that you understand every aspect of your business, and its ability to generate profit.

A business plan is more than just a document that you present to lenders and investors; it also helps you plan for the growth and progress of your business. Proper planning can help your business succeed.

Visitors to Canada
Have proper identification
You must carry proper identification for yourself and any children travelling with you to help confirm your legal right or authorization to enter Canada when you arrive.

All visitors arriving from or transiting through the United States should visit the U.S. Customs and Border Protection website for information concerning the requirements to enter, transit through, or return to the United States.

Identification requirements for U. S. citizens and permanent residents
If you are a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, you must carry proof of citizenship such as a passport, birth certificate, a certificate of citizenship or naturalization, a U.S. Permanent Resident Card, or a Certificate of Indian Status along with photo identification. If you are a U.S. permanent resident, ensure you carry proof of your status such as a U.S. Permanent Resident Card.

For members of a Trusted Traveller program
U.S. citizens
U.S. citizens who are members of the NEXUS program can use their membership card as proof of identification and citizenship when entering Canada by land, air or water. This applies when you are using either conventional or NEXUS-only lanes.  U.S. citizens who are members of FAST may use their membership card when entering Canada by land or water only. When travelling by air, FAST cards will only be accepted as proof of identification when you are travelling to Canada from the U.S.

U.S. permanent residents
NEXUS and FAST members who are permanent residents of the U.S. must still travel with a passport and proof of permanent residence. You may be asked to present these documents to the Border Services Officer (BSO) when you arrive at the border.

No matter your mode of travel, we recommend you carry a valid passport for all travel abroad, including visits to Canada from the United States. A passport may be required by your airline or other transportation authority, since it is the only universally-accepted identification document.

Identification requirements for international visitors
All international travellers must carry acceptable identification and a valid visa (if necessary) when entering Canada. A passport is recommended because it is the only reliable and universally-accepted travel and identification document for the purpose of international travel.

Electronic Travel Authorization
Visa-exempt foreign nationals need an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) to fly to or transit through Canada. Exceptions include U.S. citizens, U.S. Lawful Permanent Residents (USLPR) and travellers with a valid Canadian visa. Canadian citizens, including dual citizens, and Canadian permanent residents cannot apply for an eTA.

Foreign nationals from select visa-required countries may also travel to or through Canada by air using an eTA, if eligible.

Be prepared: Apply for an eTA before you book your flight to Canada. Most applicants get approved within minutes.

Canadian history does not begin with the arrival of European explorers over 500 years ago; people have been living in the country that we now call Canada for thousands of years.

Canada’s original inhabitants
Centuries before Europeans began to settle in North America, explorers who came here found thriving First Nations and Inuit societies with their own beliefs, way of life and rich history.

When the first European explorers came to Canada they found all regions occupied by native peoples they called “Indians,” thinking they had reached the East Indies. The native people lived off the land, some by hunting and gathering, others by raising crops.

The Huron-Wendat of the Great Lakes Region, like the Iroquois, were farmers and hunters. The Cree and Dene of the Northwest were hunter-gatherers. The Sioux were nomadic, following the bison (buffalo) herd. The Inuit lived off Arctic wildlife. West Coast natives preserved fish by drying and smoking. Warfare was common among Aboriginal groups as they competed for land, resources and prestige.

The arrival of European traders, missionaries, soldiers and colonists changed the native way of life forever. Large numbers of Aboriginals died of European diseases to which they lacked immunity. However, Aboriginals and Europeans formed strong economic, religious and military bonds in the first 200 years of coexistence which laid the foundations of Canada.

The new Dominion of Canada
Today, Canada is made up of 10 provinces and three territories.

However, when the British North America Act, 1867, (now the Constitution Acts, 1867 to 1982) created the new Dominion of Canada, there were only four provinces – Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.

The Northwest Territories and Manitoba
The year 1870 – three years after Confederation – brought multiple historic changes to land ownership, including:

Canada’s purchase of Rupert’s Land from the Hudson’s Bay Company, which had been granted a charter to the area by the British government exactly two centuries earlier. Rupert's Land spanned all land drained by rivers flowing into Hudson Bay – roughly 40 per cent of present-day Canada. The selling price was 300,000 pounds sterling.
Britain’s transfer of the North-Western Territory to Canada. Previously, the Hudson’s Bay Company had an exclusive licence to trade in this area, which stretched west to the colony of British Columbia and north to the Arctic Circle. When it was discovered in the mid-1800s that the Prairies had enormous farming potential, the British government refused to renew the company’s licence. With the Hudson's Bay Company out of the area, Britain was free to turn it over to Canada.

The transition to a cleaner, prosperous economy needs to be both an immediate priority and a sustained effort over the years and decades ahead. Canada must keep innovating to meet this long-term goal, strengthening and building on existing measures that fight climate change and transform the economy.

To avert the worst impacts of climate change, the Government of Canada is committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.

This goal will require support and engagement from all parts of society, including provinces and territories, cities, Indigenous Peoples, youth, and businesses.

What is Net-Zero?
Achieving net-zero emissions means our economy either emits no greenhouse gas emissions or offsets its emissions, for example, through actions such as tree planting or employing technologies that can capture carbon before it is released into the air. This is essential to keeping the world safe and livable for our kids and grandkids.

Canada  has joined over 120 countries in committing to be net-zero emissions by 2050, including all other G7 nations (United Kingdom, United States, Germany, Italy, France, and Japan), A number of provinces and cities have already made net-zero-by-2050 commitments, including Guelph, Vancouver, Hamilton, Toronto, Halifax, Newfoundland and Labrador, and most recently Quebec. Prince Edward Island has also pledged to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040. Nova Scotia and British Columbia have put into place, or plan to put into place, provincial net-zero-by-2050 legislation.

Canada’s plan to reach Net-Zero
The Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act, which became law on June 29, 2021, enshrines in legislation Canada’s commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. The Act ensures transparency and accountability as the government works to deliver on its targets. The Act requires public participation and independent advice to guide the Government of Canada’s efforts.

2030 Emissions Reduction Plan: Clean Air, Strong Economy
Building on the actions in Canada’s strengthened climate plan (2020), and the Pan-Canadian Framework (2016), the 2030 Emissions Reduction Plan (2022) provides a roadmap to how Canada will meet its enhanced Paris Agreement target to reduce emissions by 40-45% from 2005 levels by 2030.

The Government of Canada published the country’s 2030 Emissions Reduction Plan in March 2022. The plan reflects input from provinces, territories, Indigenous Peoples, the Net-Zero Advisory Body, and interested Canadians on what is needed to reach Canada’s more ambitious climate target of 40-45% emissions reductions by 2030.

Net-Zero Advisory Body
The Net-Zero Advisory Body (NZAB) was launched in February 2021. With up to 15 members that bring together relevant experience and knowledge, the Advisory Body provides independent advice to the Minister of Environment and Climate Change that supports achieving Canada’s net-zero target.

COVID-19 symptoms
Symptoms of COVID-19 can vary:

from person to person
in different age groups
depending on the COVID-19 variant
Some of the more commonly reported symptoms include:

sore throat
runny nose
sneezing
new or worsening cough
shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
temperature equal to or more than 38°C
feeling feverish
chills
fatigue or weakness
muscle or body aches
new loss of smell or taste
headache
abdominal pain, diarrhea and vomiting
feeling very unwell
If you don’t feel well or if you have any symptoms, even if mild, assume you may have COVID-19. Immediately isolate at home and away from others. Check with your local public health authority for more advice, including where and how to get tested if recommended.

You may be infected but not have symptoms. However, you can still spread the virus to others. You may:

develop symptoms later (be pre-symptomatic)
never develop symptoms (be asymptomatic)
If you’ve been in contact with someone who has COVID-19, contact your local public health authority for advice on what to do next.

Start of symptoms
You may start experiencing symptoms anywhere from 1 to 14 days after exposure. Typically, symptoms appear between 3 and 7 days after exposure.  

Vaccination prevents severe illness
Vaccination is one of the most effective ways to protect our families, communities and ourselves against COVID-19. Evidence indicates that the vaccines used in Canada are very effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19.

However, vaccines are not 100% effective and you may still become infected with or without symptoms.

Today, it seems impossible to imagine Canada by any other name. However, there were a number of other interesting suggestions and events leading up to the formal christening of our nation in 1867.

Aboriginal roots
The naming of a nation
Aboriginal roots
The name “Canada” likely comes from the Huron-Iroquois word “kanata,” meaning “village” or “settlement.” In 1535, two Aboriginal youths told French explorer Jacques Cartier about the route to kanata; they were actually referring to the village of Stadacona, the site of the present-day City of Québec. For lack of another name, Cartier used the word “Canada” to describe not only the village, but the entire area controlled by its chief, Donnacona.

The name was soon applied to a much larger area; maps in 1547 designated everything north of the St. Lawrence River as Canada. Cartier also called the St. Lawrence River the “rivière du Canada,” a name used until the early 1600s. By 1616, although the entire region was known as New France, the area along the great river of Canada and the Gulf of St. Lawrence was still called Canada.

Soon explorers and fur traders opened up territory to the west and to the south, and the area known as Canada grew. In the early 1700s, the name referred to all French lands in what is now the American Midwest and as far south as present-day Louisiana.

The first use of Canada as an official name came in 1791, when the Province of Quebec was divided into the colonies of Upper Canada and Lower Canada. In 1841, the two colonies were united under one name, the Province of Canada.

Two Aboriginal youths telling Jacques Cartier about the route to the village of Stadacona, site of the present day City of Québec.
The naming of a nation
Leading up to the proposed confederation, a number of names were suggested for the northern half of the continent of North America, including: Albertsland, Albionora, Borealia, Britannia, Cabotia, Colonia, EfisgaFootnote1, Hochelaga, Norland, Superior, Transatlantia, TuponiaFootnote2, and Victorialand.

The debate was placed in perspective by Thomas D’Arcy McGee, who declared on February 9, 1865:

“I read in one newspaper not less than a dozen attempts to derive a new name. One individual chooses Tuponia and another Hochelaga as a suitable name for the new nationality. Now I ask any honourable member of this House how he would feel if he woke up some fine morning and found himself instead of a Canadian, a Tuponian or a Hochelagander.”

Fortunately for posterity, McGee’s wit and reasoning – along with common sense – prevailed, and on July 1, 1867, the provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick became “one Dominion under the name of Canada.”",utf-8,"['Origin of the name ""Canada""', 'Today, it seems impossible to imagine Canada by any other name.

On June 21, 2019, an Act respecting national security matters (the National Security Act, 2017) received royal assent.

This legislation modernizes and enhances Canada’s security and intelligence laws by providing our agencies with the clear constitutional and legal framework they need to do their work effectively while safeguarding Canadians’ rights and freedoms.

The National Security Act, 2017 accomplishes three important objectives:

Enhancing accountability and transparency
The results of the public consultation on national security demonstrated a demand from the public for increased accountability and greater transparency on national security matters. The National Security Act, 2017 addresses this demand in a number of ways as outlined in this section.

Fulfilling commitments to address former C-51
Canadians were clear in the consultation they expect their rights and freedoms to be protected at the same time as their security. The measures outlined in this section demonstrate how the National Security Act, 2017 addresses the problematic elements of former Bill C-51.

Strengthening security and protecting rights
As the threat environment has evolved, so too must the legislative landscape and the political environment in which it operates. The measures outlined in this section demonstrate how the National Security Act, 2017 strengthens Canada's ability to address new threats and safeguard Canadian's rights and freedoms.",utf-8,"['Our Security, Our Rights', '', 'On June 21, 2019, an Act respecting national security matters (the National Security Act, 2017) received royal assent.', '', 'This legislation modernizes and enhances Canada’s security and intelligence laws by providing our agencies with the clear constitutional and legal framework they need to do their work effectively while safeguarding Canadians’ rights and freedoms.', '', 'The National Security Act, 2017 accomplishes three important objectives:', '', 'Enhancing accountability and transparency', 'The results of the public consultation on national security demonstrated a demand from the public for increased accountability and greater transparency on national security matters.

Overview
The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) retirement pension is a monthly, taxable benefit that replaces part of your income when you retire. If you qualify, you’ll receive the CPP retirement pension for the rest of your life. To qualify you must:

be at least 60 years old
have made at least one valid contribution to the CPP
Valid contributions can be either from work you did in Canada, or as the result of receiving credits from a former spouse or former common-law partner at the end of the relationship.

You must apply
CPP payments are not automatic. You must apply. You should apply in advance of when you want your pension to start.

Our goal is to pay your CPP retirement pension in the month of the start date you choose.

Pension amount
The amount you receive each month is based on your average earnings throughout your working life, your contributions to the CPP, and the age you decide to start your CPP retirement pension. Your contributions to the CPP are based on your earnings.

The standard age to start the pension is 65. However, you can start receiving it as early as age 60 or as late as age 70.

If you start receiving your pension earlier, the monthly amount you’ll receive will be smaller. If you decide to start later, you’ll receive a larger monthly amount. There’s no benefit to wait after age 70 to start receiving the pension. The maximum monthly amount you can receive is reached when you turn 70.

There are different factors that can affect how much you'll receive, such as time taken off from work to care for young children. Find out more about how much you could receive. You can also work while receiving a CPP retirement pension.

How long will it take to process your application
We begin to process your application once we receive your completed application form. You should receive a notice of our decision by mail within 120 days.

It could take longer to process your application if Service Canada does not have a complete application.

You may also qualify for other CPP benefits
In addition to the CPP retirement pension, you may also quality for other CPP benefits listed below. Like the CPP retirement pension, you will need to apply for these benefits (except for the Post-retirement benefit if you already receive the CPP retirement pension).

Post-retirement benefit
Disability pension
Post-retirement disability benefit
Survivor's pension
Children's benefit
Death benefit
CPP enhancement
As of 2019, the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is gradually being enhanced. This means that today’s workers, the seniors of tomorrow, will have higher benefits and greater financial stability through a small increase in the amount they contribute to the CPP.

The CPP enhancement only affects those who work and contribute to the CPP in 2019 or after.

The enhancement adds 2 additional components to the CPP. These components are not a separate benefit, but a ‘top-up’ to the base CPP.

The CPP now consists of:

How much you could receive
From: Employment and Social Development Canada

On this page
You could get up to 55% of your earnings
You can get benefits for up to a maximum of 45 weeks
How we calculate your weekly benefit amount
If your net family income is $25,921 or less
Taxes are deducted from EI payments
You could get up to 55% of your earnings
We can’t tell you exactly how much you’ll receive before we process your application. For most people, the basic rate for calculating Employment Insurance (EI) benefits is 55% of their average insurable weekly earnings, up to a maximum amount. As of January 1, 2023, the maximum yearly insurable earnings amount is $61,500. This means that you can receive a maximum amount of $650 per week.

Insurable earnings include most of the different types of compensation from employment, such as wages, tips, bonuses and commissions. The Canada Revenue Agency determines what types of earnings are insurable.

You can get benefits for up to a maximum of 45 weeks
You can receive EI from 14 weeks up to a maximum of 45 weeks, depending on the unemployment rate in your region at the time of filing your claim and the amount of insurable hours you've accumulated in the last 52 weeks or since your last claim, whichever is shorter.

Seasonal workers
Number of weeks of EI regular benefits payable by regional rate of unemployment
The number of weeks for which you may receive benefits doesn’t change if you move to another region after your benefit period begins.

How we calculate your weekly benefit amount
The amount of weekly benefits is calculated as follows:

we calculate your total insurable earnings for the required number of best weeks (the weeks that you earned the most money, including insurable tips and commissions) based on the information you provide and/or your record(s) of employment
we determine the divisor (number of best weeks) that corresponds to your regional rate of unemployment
we divide your total insurable earnings for your best weeks by your required number of best weeks
we then multiply the result by 55% to obtain the amount of your weekly benefits
In regions of Canada with the highest rates of unemployment, we’ll calculate using the best 14 weeks. In regions of Canada with the lowest rates of unemployment, we’ll use the best 22 weeks. In other regions, the number of weeks used to calculate benefits will be somewhere between 14 and 22, depending on the unemployment rate in those regions.

A constitution provides the fundamental rules and principles that govern a country. It creates many of the institutions and branches of government, and defines their powers.

Did you know?
Canada was created by an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom called the British North America Act, 1867 (now known as the Constitution Act, 1867) uniting the British colonies of the United Province of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick.
The Constitution of Canada includes the Constitution Act, 1867, and the Constitution Act, 1982. It is the supreme law of Canada. It reaffirms Canada's dual legal system and also includes Aboriginal rights and treaty rights.

What does our Constitution say?
The Constitution sets out the basic principles of democratic government in Canada when it defines the powers of the three branches of government:

the executive
the legislative
the judiciary
Did you know?
The Constitution was ""patriated"" from the United Kingdom in 1982.

When Canada was created, it was a self-governing British colony. The British North America Act, 1867, codified many constitutional rules for Canada, but major changes to the Constitution could only be made by the United Kingdom Parliament. In 1982, the Charter was enacted as part of Canada's Constitution along with a set of procedures allowing the Constitution to be amended in Canada.

The Queen has the executive power in Canada, but in our democratic society the Queen's powers are exercised by constitutional convention on the advice of Ministers who enjoy the confidence of the House of Commons. Together, the Prime Minister and other Ministers form the cabinet, which is responsible to Parliament for government business. Ministers are also responsible for government departments, such as the Department of Finance and the Department of Justice. When we say ""the government,"" we are usually referring to the executive branch.

Parliament is the legislative branch of the federal government. Parliament consists of the Queen (who is usually represented by the Governor General), the Senate and the House of Commons. Bills are debated and passed by the Senate and the House of Commons. The Governor General must also give royal assent to a bill in order for it to become a law. By constitutional convention, royal assent is always given to bills passed by the Senate and the House of Commons.

The Department of Justice
The Minister of Justice is responsible for the Department of Justice, which provides legal services such as drafting laws and providing legal advice to the government and its departments. The department also develops criminal law and public law, as well as policies and programs for victims, families, children and youth criminal justice. The Minister of Justice is also the Attorney General or chief law officer of Canada

Overview
The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) disability benefit is a monthly payment you can get if you:

are under 65
have made enough contributions into the CPP
have a mental or physical disability that regularly stops you from doing any type of substantially gainful work
have a disability that is long-term and of indefinite duration, or is likely to result in death
Find out if you might be eligible.

Two types of CPP disability benefits
Benefit name	Age	Must be
CPP disability benefit	Under 65	Not receiving the CPP retirement pension
CPP post-retirement disability benefit	From 60 to 65	Already receiving the CPP retirement pension for more than 15 months or become disabled after starting to receive the retirement pension
When you turn 65 your CPP disability benefit is automatically changed to a CPP retirement pension.

Children's benefit
If you are getting a disability benefit, your dependent children may be able to get a monthly payment.

Benefit name	Age	Must be
CPP Children's benefit	Under 18 or between the ages of 18 and 25 and in full-time attendance at a recognized school or university	The child of a person receiving a disability benefit
Find out more about the CPP Children's benefit.

When you should apply
You have to apply for this benefit. You should apply for this benefit as soon as possible.

When payments start
Your decision letter will give you the date and amount of your first payment.

How long for a decision
It can take up to 4 months for a decision to be made. The date your application form is received may affect the date your benefit begins. Do not wait for your completed medical form before sending your completed application form.

However, a decision on your application can only be made when you have sent both of the following:

a complete application form (including questionnaire and signed consent form)
a signed medical report
For eligible disabilities, we aim to make a decision on your eligibility within 120 calendar days (4 months).

If we confirm your condition is grave, we aim to process your application within 30 calendar days.

If we confirm you have a terminal illness, we aim to process your application within 5 business days.

Definitions
Substantially gainful work
Substantially gainful work is a job that pays wages equal to or greater than the maximum annual amount a person could receive as a disability pension. In 2023, this amount is $18,508.36 (before tax).

Once you have earned $6,600 (before tax) in 2023, you must contact Service Canada. Your disability benefits may be impacted by your gross (before tax) earnings:

if you earn below $6,600 (before tax), this alone should not affect your disability benefits
if you earn between $6,600 and $18,508.36 (before tax), this may show that you are regularly capable of working and it may affect your disability benefits
if you earn $18,508.36 (before tax) or more, this demonstrates you are regularly capable of working and you will likely",ascii,"['Canada Pension Plan disability benefits', '', 'Overview', 'The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) disability benefit is a monthly payment you can get if you:', '', 'are under 65', 'have made enough contributions into the CPP', 'have a mental or physical disability that regularly stops you from doing any type of substantially gainful work', 'have a disability that is long-term and of indefinite duration, or is likely to result in death', 'Find out if you might be eligible.', '', 'Two types of CPP disability benefits', 'Benefit name\tAge\tMust be', 'CPP disability benefit\tUnder 65\tNot receiving the CPP retirement pension', 'CPP post-retirement disability benefit\tFrom 60 to 65\tAlready receiving the CPP retirement pension for more than 15 months or become disabled after starting to receive the retirement pension', 'When you turn 65 your CPP disability benefit is automatically changed to a CPP retirement pension.', '', ""Children's benefit"", 'If you are getting a disability benefit, your dependent children may be able to get a monthly payment.', '', 'Benefit name\tAge\tMust be', ""CPP Children's benefit\tUnder 18 or between the ages of 18 and 25 and in full-time attendance at a recognized school or university\tThe child of a person receiving a disability benefit"", ""Find out more about the CPP Children's benefit."", '', 'When you should apply', 'You have to apply for this benefit.

1. Introduc tion
The scope o f this teaching package is to  make a brief induction to Artifici al Neur al
Networks (ANNs)   for peo ple who have  no prev ious knowledge o f them. W e first make a  brief
introduction to mo dels o f networks,  for then descr ibing in general  terms ANNs. As a n
applicatio n, we explai n the backpropagatio n algor ithm, since i t is widely used and many other
algor ithms are  deriv ed from i t. 
The user s hould know algebr a and the handling of funct ions and vectors . Differentia l
calculus i s recomme ndable, but not necessar y. The contents of th is package  should be
understoo d by p eople with high scho ol education. It woul d be useful fo r peo ple who are  just
curio us abo ut what a re ANNs, or for people  who want to beco me fami liar with th em, so  when
they study th em m ore fully, they will already have clear notions of AN Ns. Also, people w ho
only want to apply the bac kpropagation a lgorithm without a detailed  and formal  explanation
of it will find this material  useful. Th is work  should not  be seen as “Net s for d ummies ”, but of
course  it is not a treatis e. Much of the formal ity is skipped for  the sake o f simplici ty. D etailed
explanations and demonstrations can be found in the referred readings. The included exercises

2. Networ ks
One efficient wa y of solving complex problems is following th e lemma “divide and
conquer ”. A complex  system may be decompos ed into simple r elements, in order t o be able
to understand it. Also s imple elements may be gathered to pro duce a comple x system (B ar
Yam, 1997). Networks are on e ap proach  for achievin g this. There are a l arge nu mber of
different typ es of networks, but they all are characteri zed by the follo wing components: a s et
of nodes , and connections be tween nodes.
The nodes can be seen as co mputational units. They rece ive inputs, and p rocess them
to obt ain an output. This processing might be ver y simp le (such as summi ng the inputs), or
quite com plex (a  node mi ght c ontain ano ther network...)
The connections de termine  the informa tion flow between nodes . They can be
unidirectional, when the information flows only in one sense, and bidirectional, when the
inform ation flo ws in either  sense .
The interactions of nodes though the connect ions lead to a global behaviour of the
network, which cannot be obs erved in the ele ments of the network. This glo bal be havio ur is
said to be emergent . This means that the abilities of the  network supercede the ones of its
elements, maki ng netw orks a ve ry powerful too l.Networks ar e use d to model a  wide range  of phenome na in p hysics, computer sci ence,
biochemistry, ethology, mathematics, sociology, economics, telecommunications, and m any

The government of Canada (French: gouvernement du Canada) is the body responsible for the federal administration of Canada. A constitutional monarchy, the Crown assumes distinct roles: the executive, as the Crown-in-Council; the legislative, as the Crown-in-Parliament; and the judicial, as the Crown-on-the-Bench.[3][4][5] Three institutions—the Privy Council (conventionally, the Cabinet), the Parliament, and the judiciary, respectively—exercise the powers of the Crown.

The term Government of Canada (French: Gouvernement du Canada) refers specifically to the executive, which includes ministers of the Crown (together in the Cabinet) and the federal civil service (whom the Cabinet direct); what is formally known as His Majesty's Government (French: Gouvernement de Sa Majesté)[6][7][8][9] and is corporately branded as the Government of Canada. There are over 100 departments and agencies, as well as over 300,000 persons employed in the Government of Canada. These institutions carry out the programs and enforce the laws established by the Parliament of Canada.

The federal government's organization and structure was established at Confederation, through the Constitution Act, 1867, wherein the Canadian Crown acts as the core, or ""the most basic building block"",[10] of its Westminster-style parliamentary democracy.[11] The monarch, King Charles III, is personally represented by a governor general (currently Mary Simon) and is head of state. A prime minister (currently Justin Trudeau) is the head of government, who is invited by the Crown to form a government after securing the confidence of the House of Commons, which is typically determined through the election of enough mem",utf-8,"['', 'Main menu', '', 'WikipediaThe Free Encyclopedia', 'Search Wikipedia', 'Search', 'Create account', 'Log in', '', 'Personal tools', 'Contents hide', '(Top)', 'Terminology', 'Monarchy', 'Executive power', 'Toggle Executive power subsection', 'Prime minister', 'Privy Council', 'Cabinet', 'Legislative power', 'Toggle Legislative power subsection', 'Role of the Crown', 'House of Commons', 'Senate', 'Judicial', 'Federalism', 'Political culture', 'See also', 'References', 'Toggle References subsection', 'Notes', 'Citations', 'Further reading', 'External links', 'Government of Canada', '', 'Article', 'Talk', 'Read', 'Edit', 'View history', '', 'Tools', 'From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia', 'Government of Canada', 'Gouvernement du Canada', 'Constitutional monarchy', 'Coat of arms of Canada', 'Coat of arms of Canada', 'Formation\t1 July 1867; 156 years ago', 'Founding document\tConstitution Act, 1867', 'Country\tCanada', 'Website\twww.canada.ca', 'Crown', 'Head of state (sovereign)\tMonarch', 'Vice-regal representative\tGovernor General', 'Seat\tRideau Hall', 'Legislative', '(King-in-Parliament)', 'Legislature\tParliament', 'House of Commons', 'Senate', 'Meeting place\tHouse of Commons: West Block[1]', 'Senate: Senate of Canada Building[2]', 'Executive', '(King-in-Council)', 'Head of government\tPrime Minister', 'Main body\tCabinet', 'Main organ\tPrivy Council (de jure)', 'Cabinet (de facto)', 'Judicial', '(King-on-the-Bench)', 'Court\tSupreme Court of Canada (highest court)', 'Seat\tSupreme Court Building, Ottawa', 'The government of Canada (French: gouvernement du Canada) is the body responsible for the federal administration of Canada.

Slide 1
Health Canada (HC; French: Santé Canada, SC)[NB 1] is the department of the Government of Canada responsible for national health policy. The department itself is also responsible for numerous federal health-related agencies, including the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), among others. These organizations help to ensure compliance with federal law in a variety of healthcare, agricultural, and pharmaceutical activities. This responsibility also involves extensive collaboration with various other federal- and provincial-level organizations in order to ensure the safety of food, health, and pharmaceutical products—including the regulation of health research and pharmaceutical manufacturing/testing facilities.

Slide 1
Health Canada (HC; French: Santé Canada, SC)[NB 1] is the department of the Government of Canada responsible for national health policy. The department itself is also responsible for numerous federal health-related agencies, including the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), among others. These organizations help to ensure compliance with federal law in a variety of healthcare, agricultural, and pharmaceutical activities. This responsibility also involves extensive collaboration with various other federal- and provincial-level organizations in order to ensure the safety of food, health, and pharmaceutical products—including the regulation of health research and pharmaceutical manufacturing/testing facilities.
Slide 2
The department is responsible to Parliament through the minister of health—presently Jean-Yves Duclos—as part of the federal health portfolio.[3] The minister is assisted by the associate minister of health, and minister of mental health and addictions—presently Carolyn Bennett. The deputy minister of health, the senior most civil servant within the department, is responsible for the day-to-day leadership and operations of the department and reports directly to the minister.
Slide 3
Originally created as the ""Department of Health"" in 1919—in the wake of the Spanish flu crisis[4]—what is known as Health Canada today was formed in 1993 from the former Health and Welfare Canada department (established in 1944), which split into two separate units; the other department being Human Resources and Labour Canada.[5]",,,,,,16,8,0,0,,Test Author One,Test last_modified_by One,False,,,,,,,,,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The federal government of the United States (U.S. federal government or U.S. government)[a] is the national government of the United States, a federal republic located primarily in North America, composed of 50 states, five major self-governing territories, several island possessions, and the federal district and national capital of Washington, D.C., where most of the federal government is based.

The U.S. federal government, sometimes simply referred to as ""Washington"", is composed of three distinct branches: legislative, executive, and judicial, whose powers are vested by the U.S. Constitution in the Congress, the president, and the federal courts, respectively. The powers and duties of these branches are further defined by acts of Congress, including the creation of executive departments and courts subordinate to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Naming

A diagram of the political system of the United States
The full name of the republic is ""United States of America"". No other name appears in the Constitution, and this is the name that appears on money, in treaties, and in legal cases to which the nation is a party. The terms ""Government of the United States of America"" or ""United States Government"" are often used in official documents to represent the federal government as distinct from the states collectively.

Health Canada (HC; French: Santé Canada, SC)[NB 1] is the department of the Government of Canada responsible for national health policy. The department itself is also responsible for numerous federal health-related agencies, including the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), among others. These organizations help to ensure compliance with federal law in a variety of healthcare, agricultural, and pharmaceutical activities. This responsibility also involves extensive collaboration with various other federal- and provincial-level organizations in order to ensure the safety of food, health, and pharmaceutical products—including the regulation of health research and pharmaceutical manufacturing/testing facilities.
The department is responsible to Parliament through the minister of health—presently Jean-Yves Duclos—as part of the federal health portfolio.[3] The minister is assisted by the associate minister of health, and minister of mental health and addictions—presently Carolyn Bennett. The deputy minister of health, the senior most civil servant within the department, is responsible for the day-to-day leadership and operations of the department and reports directly to the minister.
Originally created as the ""Department of Health"" in 1919—in the wake of the Spanish flu crisis[4]—what is known as Health Canada today was formed in 1993 from the former Health and Welfare Canada department (established in 1944), which split into two separate units; the other department being Human Resources and Labour Canada.[5]",,,,,,16,8,0,0,,Test Author One,Test last_modified_by One,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1. Introduc tion
The scope o f this teaching package is to  make a brief induction to Artifici al Neur al
Networks (ANNs)   for peo ple who have  no prev ious knowledge o f them. W e first make a  brief
introduction to mo dels o f networks,  for then descr ibing in general  terms ANNs. As a n
applicatio n, we explai n the backpropagatio n algor ithm, since i t is widely used and many other
algor ithms are  deriv ed from i t. 
The user s hould know algebr a and the handling of funct ions and vectors . Differentia l
calculus i s recomme ndable, but not necessar y. The contents of th is package  should be
understoo d by p eople with high scho ol education. It woul d be useful fo r peo ple who are  just
curio us abo ut what a re ANNs, or for people  who want to beco me fami liar with th em, so  when
they study th em m ore fully, they will already have clear notions of AN Ns. Also, people w ho
only want to apply the bac kpropagation a lgorithm without a detailed  and formal  explanation
of it will find this material  useful. Th is work  should not  be seen as “Net s for d ummies ”, but of
course  it is not a treatis e. Much of the formal ity is skipped for  the sake o f simplici ty. D etailed
explanations and demonstrations can be found in the referred readings. The included exercises
complem ent the und erstanding of th e theor y. The on-line reso urces are hi ghly  recomme nded
for extending th is brief induction.
2. Networ ks
One efficient wa y of solving complex problems is following th e lemma “divide and
conquer ”. A complex  system may be decompos ed into simple r elements, in order t o be able
to understand it. Also s imple elements may be gathered to pro duce a comple x system (B ar
Yam, 1997). Networks are on e ap proach  for achievin g this. There are a l arge nu mber of
different typ es of networks, but they all are characteri zed by the follo wing components: a s et
of nodes , and connections be tween nodes.
The nodes can be seen as co mputational units. They rece ive inputs, and p rocess them
to obt ain an output. This processing might be ver y simp le (such as summi ng the inputs), or
quite com plex (a  node mi ght c ontain ano ther network...)
The connections de termine  the informa tion flow between nodes . They can be
unidirectional, when the information flows only in one sense, and bidirectional, when the
inform ation flo ws in either  sense .
The interactions of nodes though the connect ions lead to a global behaviour of the
network, which cannot be obs erved in the ele ments of the network. This glo bal be havio ur is
said to be emergent . This means that the abilities of the  network supercede the ones of its
elements, maki ng netw orks a ve ry powerful too l.Networks ar e use d to model a  wide range  of phenome na in p hysics, computer sci ence,
biochemistry, ethology, mathematics, sociology, economics, telecommunications, and m any
other ",,,,,,0,0,0,0,,Carlos Gershenson,,False,Corel PDF Engine Version 11.245,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Health Canada (HC; French: Santé Canada, SC)[NB 1] is the department of the Government of Canada 
responsible for national health p olicy. The department itself is also responsible for numerous federal 
health -related agencies, including the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and the Public Health 
Agency of Canada (PHAC), among others. These organizations help to ensure compliance w ith federal 
law in a variety of healthcare, agricultural, and pharmaceutical activities. This responsibility also involves 
extensive collaboration with various other federal - and provincial -level organizations in order to ensure 
the safety of food, health,  and pharmaceutical products —including the regulation of health research 
and pharmaceutical manufacturing/testing facilities.  
The department is responsible to Parliament through the minister of health —presently Jean -Yves 
Duclos—as part of the federal heal th portfolio.[3] The minister is assisted by the associate minister of 
health, and minister of mental health and addictions —presently Carolyn Bennett. The deputy minister 
of health, the senior most civil servant within the department, is responsible for th e day -to-day 
leadership and operations of the department and reports directly to the minister.  
Originally created as the ""Department of Health"" in 1919 —in the wake of the Spanish flu crisis[4] —what 
is known as Health Canada today was formed in 1993 from t he former Health and Welfare Canada 
department (established in 1944), which split into two separate units; the other department being 
Human Resources and Labour Canada.[5]  ",,,,,,15,8,0,0,,"Gavigan, Patrick (HC/SC)",,False,Microsoft® Word for Microsoft 365,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The government of Canada (French: gouvernement du Canada) is the body responsible for the federal administration of Canada. A constitutional monarchy, the Crown assumes distinct roles: the executive, as the Crown-in-Council; the legislative, as the Crown-in-Parliament; and the judicial, as the Crown-on-the-Bench.[3][4][5] Three institutions—the Privy Council (conventionally, the Cabinet), the Parliament, and the judiciary, respectively—exercise the powers of the Crown.

The term Government of Canada (French: Gouvernement du Canada) refers specifically to the executive, which includes ministers of the Crown (together in the Cabinet) and the federal civil service (whom the Cabinet direct); what is formally known as His Majesty's Government (French: Gouvernement de Sa Majesté)[6][7][8][9] and is corporately branded as the Government of Canada. There are over 100 departments and agencies, as well as over 300,000 persons employed in the Government of Canada. These institutions carry out the programs and enforce the laws established by the Parliament of Canada.

The federal government's organization and structure was established at Confederation, through the Constitution Act, 1867, wherein the Canadian Crown acts as the core, or ""the most basic building block"",[10] of its Westminster-style parliamentary democracy.[11] The monarch, King Charles III, is personally represented by a governor general (currently Mary Simon) and is head of state. A prime minister (currently Justin Trudeau) is the head of government, who is invited by the Crown to form a government after securing the confidence of the House of Commons, which is typically determined through the election of enough mem",utf-8,"['', 'Main menu', '', 'WikipediaThe Free Encyclopedia', 'Search Wikipedia', 'Search', 'Create account', 'Log in', '', 'Personal tools', 'Contents hide', '(Top)', 'Terminology', 'Monarchy', 'Executive power', 'Toggle Executive power subsection', 'Prime minister', 'Privy Council', 'Cabinet', 'Legislative power', 'Toggle Legislative power subsection', 'Role of the Crown', 'House of Commons', 'Senate', 'Judicial', 'Federalism', 'Political culture', 'See also', 'References', 'Toggle References subsection', 'Notes', 'Citations', 'Further reading', 'External links', 'Government of Canada', '', 'Article', 'Talk', 'Read', 'Edit', 'View history', '', 'Tools', 'From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia', 'Government of Canada', 'Gouvernement du Canada', 'Constitutional monarchy', 'Coat of arms of Canada', 'Coat of arms of Canada', 'Formation\t1 July 1867; 156 years ago', 'Founding document\tConstitution Act, 1867', 'Country\tCanada', 'Website\twww.canada.ca', 'Crown', 'Head of state (sovereign)\tMonarch', 'Vice-regal representative\tGovernor General', 'Seat\tRideau Hall', 'Legislative', '(King-in-Parliament)', 'Legislature\tParliament', 'House of Commons', 'Senate', 'Meeting place\tHouse of Commons: West Block[1]', 'Senate: Senate of Canada Building[2]', 'Executive', '(King-in-Council)', 'Head of government\tPrime Minister', 'Main body\tCabinet', 'Main organ\tPrivy Council (de jure)', 'Cabinet (de facto)', 'Judicial', '(King-on-the-Bench)', 'Court\tSupreme Court of Canada (highest court)', 'Seat\tSupreme Court Building, Ottawa', 'The government of Canada (French: gouvernement du Canada) is the body responsible for the federal administration of Canada.
