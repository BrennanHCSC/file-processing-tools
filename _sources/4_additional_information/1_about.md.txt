# About

This library was created by the Health Canada Office of the Chief Data Office Data Science Team (hc-sc-ocdo-bdpd) as a generic metadata extraction tool. Its original functionality revolved around large directory migration. Keyword search and metadata report functionalities can be used to identify eligible files for migration, and the file similarity tool eliminates duplicate files.
